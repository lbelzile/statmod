## R packages and data

You can access the data sets in **R** by installing the `hecstatmod` package from Github using the following commands (uncomment the first line to install the  `remotes` and `learnr` libraries --- do only once):


```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
lib <- c("remotes", "dplyr", "MASS", "broom", 
         "car", "nlme", "lme4",
         "survival", "ggplot2", "tidyr")
for(pack in lib){
  if(!require(pack, quietly = TRUE)){
    install.packages(pack)
  }
}
remotes::install_github("lbelzile/hecstatmod")
remotes::install_github("lbelzile/hecedsm")
```


*Note*: not all data sets are currently documented in `hecstatmod`. Please re-install the package periodically to benefit from the latest features.
