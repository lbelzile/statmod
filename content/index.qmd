The course content is divided in chapters: for each topic,
readers have access to course notes, sample code and exercises sheets.


## R packages and data

You can access the data sets in **R** by installing the `hecstatmod` package. The following chunk will install all **R** packages that are used throughout the course.


```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
lib <- c("afex", "broom", "car", "dplyr", "emmeans",
         "ggplot2", "Hmisc", "lme4", "lmerTest", 
         "marginaleffects", "MASS", "multcomp", "nlme", 
         "patchwork", "poorman", "remotes", "survminer",
         "survival", "tidyr", "tinytable")
for(pack in lib){
  if(!require(pack, quietly = TRUE)){
    install.packages(pack)
  }
}
remotes::install_github("lbelzile/hecstatmod")
remotes::install_github("lbelzile/hecedsm")
```


*Note*: not all data sets are currently documented in `hecstatmod`. Please re-install the package periodically to benefit from the latest features.
