## Why use models?

A famous quote attributed to George Box claims that

> All models are wrong, but some are useful.

Peter McCullagh and John Nelder wrote in the preamble of their book (emphasis mine)

> Modelling in science remains, partly at least, an art. Some principles do exist, however, to guide the modeller. The first is that all models are wrong; **some, though, are better** than others and we can **search for the better ones**. At the same time we must recognize that eternal truth is not within our grasp.

## More insights on modelling

This quote by David R. Cox adds to the point:

> ...it does not seem helpful just to say that all models are wrong. The very word model implies simplification and idealization. The idea that complex physical, biological or sociological systems can be exactly described by a few formulae is patently absurd. The construction of idealized representations that **capture important stable aspects of such systems** is, however, a vital part of general scientific analysis and statistical models, especially substantive ones, do not seem essentially different from other kinds of model.


## Motivating example --- driving exams in the UK

Are driving tests in the UK easier if you live in a rural area?

## Motivating examples - smartwatches are distracting.

Eye tracking gaze distribution results show that participants were more distracted in the smartwatch condition than in the mobile phone condition, they were less distracted in the speaker condition than in the phone condition, and they were more distracted in the texting condition than in any of the others.

> A within-subject experiment was conducted in a driving simulator where 31 participants received and answered text messages under four conditions: they received notifications (1) on a mobile phone, (2) on a smartwatch, and (3) on a speaker, and then responded orally to these messages. They also (4) received messages in a “texting” condition where they had to reply through text to the notifications.

> In a laboratory study and a field experiment across five countries (in Europe, the Middle East and South Asia), we show that videoconferencing inhibits the production of creative ideas [...]  

> we demonstrate that videoconferencing hampers idea generation because it focuses communicators on a screen, which prompts a narrower cognitive focus. Our results suggest that virtual interaction comes with a cognitive cost for creative idea generation.

## Motivating examples --- suggesting amounts for donations

@Moon.VanEpps:2023

> Across seven studies, we provide evidence that quantity requests, wherein people consider multiple choice options of how much to donate (e.g., $5, $10, or $15), increase contributions compared to open-ended requests. 


> Our findings offer new conceptual insights into how quantity requests increase contributions as well as practical implications for charitable organizations to optimize contributions by leveraging the use of quantity requests.

> Customers must often decide on the quantity to purchase in addition to whether to purchase. The current research introduces and compares the quantity-sequential selling format, in which shoppers resolve the purchase and quantity decisions separately, with the quantity-integrated selling format, where shoppers simultaneously consider whether and how many to buy. Although retailers often use the sequential format, we demonstrate that the integrated format can increase purchase rates. A field experiment conducted with a large technology firm found that quantity integration yielded considerably higher sales, amounting to an increase of more than $1 million in annual revenue.

## Motivating examples --- price of oil in the Gaspe Peninsula



:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

Mayors requested  an inquiry by the [**Régie de l'énergie**](https://www.regie-energie.qc.ca/fr), a regulating agency in charge of energy prices. The report found that prices were indeed more expensive, but pointed out that there were more retailers per capita, and lower volume so their margins were higher.
