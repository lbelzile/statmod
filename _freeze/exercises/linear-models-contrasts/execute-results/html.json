Participants who reflected on their goal attainment as a transformation perceived their current state to be more authentic $(M = 5.98$, $\\text{SD} =  .82)$ compared to participants who wrote about distancing from old state or arriving at a new state $(M_{\\text{old}} = 5.62$, $\\text{SD} =  1.18$; $M_{\\text{new}} = 5.74$, $\\text{SD} =  1.07$, contrast 1: $b = .10$, $\\text{SE} =  .04$, $t(259) = 2.21$,  $p = .028).$\n\n> Further, there was no difference between participants who reflected on their goal attainment as distancing from an old state compared to arriving at a new state (contrast 2: $b = .06$, $\\text{SE} =  .08$, $t(259) = .79$,  $p = .433).$\n\n> We next examined how perceived authenticity affects information sharing. As expected, authenticity positively predicted information sharing ($b = 6.84$, $\\text{SE} =  1.87$, $t(260) = 3.66$, $p <.001$).\n\n1. Using the description from the text, write down the weights for the two contrasts listed above if the order of the conditions is `change`, `new` and `old`.\n2. Perform a global test for the `authenticity` as a function of experimental condition (`cond`)\n3. Compute contrasts and report the values of the tests. Check the marginal means and the test statistics: can you reproduce the output of the authors.\n4. Perform a simple linear regression of `words` on `authenticity` and check whether the correlation is significant.\n",
