Create a dummy variable `obesity` that indicates if a person `bmi` is equal or above 30.^[According to the World Health Organization, people with a $\\texttt{bmi} \\ge 25$ are overweight and those with $\\texttt{bmi} \\ge 30$ are obese. However, BMI is perceived as being a flawed indicator of health: see [this New York Times paper](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/06/health/body-roundness-index-bmi.html) for example.]\n2. Fit a model including suitable interactions with `obesity`, `smoker`, `bmi` and `age`.\n3. Write down the mean model equation for each combination of `obesity` and `smoker`.\n4. Test for the significance of the interactions and test whether the effect of `bmi` is the same for obese or not.\n\n\n",
