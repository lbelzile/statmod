The theory behind the statistical models will be reviewed with an emphasis on data applications in management.\n\nThe course will focus on regression models, including linear models, generalized linear models and models for longitudinal data with random effects and correlation structures. For each of these models, basic inference principles will be covered, notably hypothesis testing and estimation procedures.\n\n\n- Basic principles in inference and statistical modeling\n- Linear models\n- Generalized linear models\n- Models for longitudinal data and correlated data\n- Introduction to survival analysis\n\n\n## Learning objectives\n\nThe course learning objectives are listed [here](learningobjectives.qmd).\n\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n\nThe course is of an overview course. Students should have basic training in statistics at the level of [_Introductory Statistics with Randomization and Simulation_](https://www.openintro.org/book/isrs/) (Chapters 1--4, excluding special topics).\n\n\n## Target audience\n\nStatistical modelling is a compulsory course of the M.Sc. in Data Science and Business Analytics (Supervised Project stream) and an optional course for the Thesis stream.

If you have never programmed before, you may find there is a steep learning curve. **R** has a vibrant user community, so most routines of interest have been contributed by other users and you can get support through help forums. You may want to look at [Douglas et al. (2024) *An introduction to R*](https://alexd106.github.io/intro2R/index.html), [Julia Palms' *Introduction to R*](https://bookdown.org/palmjulia/r_intro_script/), the  free [CRAN manuals](https://cran.r-project.org/manuals.html) or similar introductions, or online courses, to brush up the basics of the programming language.\n\nFollow the [instructions](content/installation.qmd) to install **R**.\n\n# Evaluations and grades\n\n\nYour final grade will be based on \n\n- a three part group project, with due dates on Friday October 11th, November 8th and December 6th.\n- a midterm evaluation taking place on Tuesday, October 29th, from 12:00-15:00, and \n- a final examination which will take place on Thursday, December 12th, from 13:30-16:30.\n\nStudents can bring in one-sided crib-sheet (letter paper) for the midterm, and a two-sided one for the final.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTeam work counts towards your final grade only if you score more than 50% on individual evaluations.\n\n<div class=\"centered-table\">\n\n\n\n\n\n-------------------------------------\nAssignment                    Points \n---------------------------- --------\nCourse project (3 x 10 pt)      30   \n\nMidterm (30 pt)                 30   \n\nFinal examination (40 pt)       40   \n\nTotal                          100   \n-------------------------------------\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n# Course content\n\nBelow is a tentative schedule for the semester. \n\n1. **Introduction**\n    - Syllabus\n    - Motivating examples\n    - Review\n    - Statistical inference (bhypothesis testing)\n2. **Linear models**\n    - Parametrizations\n    - Parameter interpretation\n    - Coefficient of determination\n3.  **Likelihood based inference**\n    - Likelihood\n    - Maximum likelihood estimation\n    - Hypothesis tests\n4. **Linear models**\n    - Predictions\n    - Interactions\n    - Collinearity\n5. **Diagnostics for linear model hypotheses**\n    - Linear model hypotheses\n    - Graphical diagnostics\n    - Extensions and remedies\n6. **Generalized linear models**\n    - Structure of GLMs\n    - Poisson regression\n    - Contingency tables\n    - Overdispersion\n\n\n## Intellectual integrity and generative artificial intelligence\n\nPlease don't cheat! The [official policy](https://www.hec.ca/direction_services/secretariat_general/juridique/reglements_politiques/documents/REG_intellectual-integrity-students-v2.pdf) lists the school rules regarding plagiarism and academic integrity.\n\nThe midterm and final are closed book exams. Students can use generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools for the project to improve and edit the deliverables (either code or text), but only as a proof-reading tool. That is, the first draft of the text must be student's original work. Any use of generative AI must be cited adequately and students should provide their work with\n\na. details about the tool used (name and version),\nb. the list of prompts,\nc. a copy of the original draft or code,\nd. a description of any modification to the proposed output,\ne. a short reflection on the usage of generative AI.\n\n## Student services\n\nStudents with special needs should feel free to approach me so we can best discuss accommodations. Do check out [HEC Montréal's disabled students](https://www.hec.ca/en/students/support-resources/support-disabled-students/index.html) and [psychological](https://www.hec.ca/en/students/support-resources/psychological-support/index.html) support services.\n\n## Harassment and sexual violence\n\nThe Center for Harassment Intervention (BIMH) is the unique access point for all members of the community subject to harassment or sexual violence. You can reach them at 514 343-7020 or by email at [`harcelement@hec.ca`](mailto:harcelement@hec.ca) from Monday until Friday, from 8:30 until 4:30pm.\n\nIf you are in an emergency situation or fear for your safety, call emergency services at 911, followed by HEC Montréal security services at 514 340-6611.\n\n[Check the school official policy on these matters](https://www.hec.ca/direction_services/secretariat_general/juridique/reglements_politiques/documents/policy-to-prevent-and-fight-sexual-violence.pdf) for more details.\n\n## Family policy\n\nHEC now has an [official family policy](https://www.hec.ca/direction_services/secretariat_general/juridique/reglements_politiques/documents/DIR_parents-etudes.pdf), but the following guidelines reflect my own beliefs and commitments towards parent students^[Shamelessly stolen/adapted from similar policy by Drs. Melissa Cheney, Guy Grossman and Rohan Alexander]\n\n1. Babies are welcome in class as often as necessary for support feeding relationship.\n2. You are welcome to bring your child to class in order to cover unforeseeable gaps in childcare. \n3. If you come with babies or toddler, I ask that you sit close to the door so that, in case your little one needs special attention and is disrupting the learning of other students, you may step outside of class until their needs are met. Seats close to the door are reserved for parents attending class with their child.\n",
