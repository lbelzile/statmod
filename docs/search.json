Seats close to the door are reserved for parents attending class with their child.",

That is, the first draft of the text must be student’s original work. Any use of generative AI must be cited adequately and students should provide their work with\n\ndetails about the tool used (name and version),\nthe list of prompts,\na copy of the original draft or code,\na description of any modification to the proposed output,\na short reflection on the usage of generative AI.",
