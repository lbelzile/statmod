    "text": "Exercise 1.1\nA simulation study is performed to assess the behaviour of univariate tests under repeated sampling. The following algorithm was repeated 10K times for different values of \\(\\mu_0\\):\n\nSelect a random subsample of size \\(n=100\\).\nCompute the one-sample \\(t\\)-test statistic for \\(\\mathscr{H}_0: \\mu=\\mu_0\\) (versus \\(\\mathscr{H}_0: \\mu \\neq \\mu_0\\)) .\nReturn the \\(p\\)-value\n\nFigure 1 shows the percentage of the 10K \\(p\\)-values that are less than 0.05, i.e. the percentage of rejection (at the \\(5\\)% level) of \\(\\mathscr{H}_0:\\mu=\\mu_0\\) against the two-sided alternative at \\(\\mu_0 \\in \\{2.83, \\nu, 2.835, 2.84, \\ldots, 2.995, 3\\`\\). Use the resulting curve to answer the following questions:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Power curve for the one-sample \\(t\\)-test based on subsamples of size \\(n=100\\), as a function of travel time. The grey horizontal line is at 0.05, the vertical dashed line indicates the population mean \\(\\mu\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExplain why the value for the one-sample \\(t\\)-test around \\(\\mu=2.845\\) should be approximately 0.05.\nExplain why the values on the curve increase towards the right of the plot.\nSuppose we repeated the simulation study, but this time with subsamples of size \\(n=1000\\). How would the points compare for the one-sample \\(t\\)-test: should they be higher, equal, or lower than their current values?\nIs the assumption of the one-sample \\(t\\)-test valid in this example? Produce a quantile-quantile plot using the code below and hence comment on the robustness of the \\(t\\)-test to departures from the normality assumption.",

Use the simulated data to answer the following questions and briefly comment on each item\n\nWhat is the empirical coverage of the 95% confidence intervals (i.e., the percentage of intervals covering the true mean difference value)?\nPlot an histogram of the mean differences and superimpose the true mean difference in the population.\nCompute the power of the test (percentage of rejection of the null hypothesis).",
